# ld49-unstable

This game was made in 3 days during the Ludum Dare game jam.

This was my first 2d project so I learned a few things.
I also tried the new input system in Unity, it is a much more powerful tool
but still quite impractical on some aspects.
The code is a mess, some things aren't even used, but here it is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
